# Edge AI Earbud Supervisor — Smart Context-Aware Acoustic Supervisor

A lightweight, **locally-running** Edge AI system that samples ambient audio from a standard microphone, converts
short windows into 2D mel-spectrogram grids, and runs a compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to **detect specific
environmental sound events**. The classifier is only the first stage: the system is specified as four stages —
**Perception → Context/Policy → Decision → Response** — ending in a **Context Response Engine** that turns a verified
trigger into coordinated actions (audio-mode change, notification, warning, optional user-confirmed quick action, and
state restoration).

The AI acts as a **high-level supervisor / decision layer** that sits on top of existing ANC hardware. It classifies
macro-windows (~200 ms) to detect context changes, while the actual audio path is handled by low-level scripts. It does
**not** perform real-time wave inversion.

## 1. Problem

Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) improves listening comfort in steady background noise — but it can also **reduce
awareness of important environmental sounds**. A user on a busy street may need to hear an approaching emergency siren
or a vehicle horn; a parent may need to hear a doorbell or a child crying. Because ANC reduces everything uniformly,
the user has to remove the earbud or disable ANC manually — which is exactly the moment awareness matters most.

The core problem is therefore not "remove noise better". It is: **decide, locally and quickly, when the audio scene
contains a sound the user actually cares about right now.**

## 2. Proposed Solution

A lightweight local acoustic-event detection + response system that allows users to **select which supported
environmental sounds should cause a response — and what that response should be**.

Four stages are kept deliberately separate:

| Stage | Question it answers |
|---|---|
| **Perception — detection** | "What sound is currently present?" |
| **Context / policy** | "Does it matter to this user right now?" (which classes are enabled as triggers) |
| **Decision — verification** | "Is the evidence strong and stable enough to act?" (confidence + temporal rules) |
| **Response — Context Response Engine** | "What should the system do?" (audio mode, notification, warning, quick action, restoration) |

This separation is what makes the system practical: the model does the hard audio work once, the user decides what
matters, verification prevents flicker, and the response engine handles the actions — all instantly, without
retraining anything.

## 3. Core Architecture

Overall flow: **Ambient Audio → Detection → User Trigger Policy → Confidence + Temporal Verification → Context
Response Engine → Response Actions → State Restoration.**

```
Ambient microphone
   ↓  [PERCEPTION]
Audio preprocessing (raw PCM → mel-spectrogram, ~200 ms windows)
   ↓
Lightweight acoustic event classifier
   ↓
Probability / confidence per supported sound class
   ↓  [CONTEXT / POLICY]
Check user-selected trigger profile (which classes are enabled)
   ↓  [DECISION]
Temporal / event verification (sustained evidence? threshold met?)
   ↓
IF verified:
   ↓  [RESPONSE]
Context Response Engine
   ├─→ Audio mode (Max ANC / Transparency / Safety / Standby)
   ├─→ Notification ("Siren detected — Transparency mode enabled")
   ├─→ Warning / priority alert (configured high-priority events)
   ├─→ User-confirmed quick action (configured critical events — user must confirm)
   └─→ State management: release timer, cooldown, restore preferred mode
   ↓
IF detected but NOT an enabled trigger → no response; preferred mode unchanged
```

The AI sits on top of existing ANC hardware and outputs a **decision signal**. On real ANC hardware this decision would
be sent as a command to that hardware's own ANC system; in this project the mode change is simulated at software level.

**ML architecture (fixed):** one lightweight CNN, **<100K parameters** target, 16 kHz input, 200 ms windows with 50%
overlap, 64 mel bands, FFT 1024, hop 512, CPU/local inference. Large pretrained audio transformers (e.g., AST at
86M+ params) are **not** the project model; Hugging Face models may appear only as optional external baselines.

## 4. Context Response Engine

The fourth stage: pure software logic that consumes a **verified trigger** and produces coordinated response
actions. The CNN never decides what to do — only what is present.

| # | Response type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Audio-mode response | Switch to the policy-mapped mode (Max ANC / Transparency / Safety / Standby / none) |
| **B** | Notification | Human-readable message accompanying the response (e.g., "Siren detected — Transparency mode enabled") |
| **C** | Warning / priority alert | Elevated-urgency alert for configured high-priority events (e.g., smoke alarm) |
| **D** | User-confirmed quick action | For configured **critical** events: surfaces an action shortcut (e.g., "call emergency services") that runs **only after explicit user confirmation** |
| **E** | State management | Release timer → restore preferred mode after the trigger disappears; cooldown / duplicate-alert suppression; response log |

**Safety boundary (normative):** the quick action **never executes automatically** — the system may only *present*
it, and the user must explicitly confirm. It is disabled by default, applies only to user-configured critical
events, and is a UI-shortcut prototype: **no claim of guaranteed emergency detection**, and "automatic emergency
calling" is out of scope.

**Supervisor interface (demo):** the demo makes the pipeline visible — detected event + confidence, active profile,
trigger enabled/disabled, verification state, current audio mode, notification/warning state, available
user-confirmed quick action, and state restoration.

Demo pipeline: Speaker/phone → laptop mic → raw PCM → preprocessing → CNN → event probability → user policy →
temporal verification → Context Response Engine → supervisor interface.

## 5. Example Trigger Classes

Candidate classes include:

| Trigger class | Typical relevance |
|---|---|
| Emergency siren | Road / emergency-vehicle awareness |
| Vehicle horn | Traffic awareness |
| Doorbell | Home / delivery awareness |
| Baby or child crying | Home / family awareness |
| Smoke alarm | Home safety awareness |

**The supported class list was ratified in Phase 1 (2026-10-08, decision D8).** It is the alphabetical 17-class
taxonomy in `TRIGGER_CLASS_NAMES` (`src/config.py`), finalized against dataset availability, audio quality,
sufficient sample counts, class balance, relevance to earbud situational awareness, and the adequacy of evaluation.
The 18th candidate, `Smoke_Fire_Alarm`, remains **unresolved** (0 conservative public clips were found; W2).

The system does **not** claim to detect every possible environmental sound. Users enable only the supported acoustic
events they want as triggers.

## 6. User Customization

Users can create or select **profiles** — simple policy configurations that enable the trigger classes relevant to
their current situation, and configure how the Context Response Engine responds to them:

| Example profile | Enabled triggers (illustrative) |
|---|---|
| **Commuting** | Siren, Vehicle horn |
| **Travel** | Siren, Vehicle horn, station/announcement-related sounds *(only if a suitable dataset and class can be supported)* |
| **Home / Family** | Doorbell, Baby/child crying, Smoke alarm |
| **Custom** | Any user-defined subset of the supported classes |

Example behaviour (probabilities are illustrative examples, **not measured results**):

```
[Perception]     Model output:   {siren: 0.94, horn: 0.03, doorbell: 0.01, crying: 0.02}
[Context/Policy] User profile:   {siren: enabled, horn: enabled, doorbell: disabled, crying: disabled}
[Decision]       Verification:   threshold met, sustained across windows → VERIFIED
[Response]       Result:         TRIGGER — audio mode switches, notification shown,
                                 release timer armed, preferred mode restored later
```

If the model correctly detects a **doorbell** under that same profile, **no response of any kind occurs** (no mode
change, no notification), because the user did not enable the doorbell as a trigger — a required demo case.

**Architectural principle: profiles are policy configurations, not separate ML models.** One model is trained on the
supported acoustic event classes; switching or editing a profile is an instant configuration change. **No model is
retrained when the user changes their trigger profile.**

## 7. Edge-AI Motivation

Local inference is intended to **reduce dependence on cloud processing** and to provide **low-latency responses**:

- All compute runs locally on the device where audio is captured — **offline and private**, no network round-trip.
- Response latency is bounded by the inference cadence (~200–300 ms), which matters when the user may be missing an
  approaching vehicle or an alarm.
- A **lightweight model** and **short audio windows** keep the system viable on consumer hardware (and potentially
  portable to embedded targets later).
- Audio never needs to leave the device.

## 8. Project Status

**Current state (2026-10-10):** dataset acquisition, validation, preprocessing, and the Phase 3A model training +
validation analysis are EXECUTED, including the controlled experiments (preset A, preset D and preset E with
`--pool-freq-only`, clip-level evaluation) and the YAMNet frozen-embedding baseline (fit + report, experimental
only). All Phase 3B **test-split** evaluation, longer-hyperparameter training, and Phases 4-6 remain **gated on
explicit user authorization**.

In phase order, what is actually in place:

1. **Phase 1 - Dataset Investigation, Trigger-Class Definition & Class Mapping** (`data/`, `src/data/`): 10,565
   curated clips across 17 classes acquired (UrbanSound8K, FSD50K, ESC-50, owlgebra-ai/babycry), mappings fixed and
   provenance manifest built; full read-only validation verdict **PASS WITH WARNINGS**; `Smoke_Fire_Alarm`
   unresolved (0 conservative public clips found).
2. **Phase 2 - Signal Processing Pipeline** (`src/preprocessing/`): EXECUTED - 10,281 kept clips (284 excluded per
   audit flags), 15 s truncation, mono 16 kHz, 200 ms / 50%-overlap mel windows (64,5,1) scaled with train-frozen
   dB bounds, source-group-aware covariate-balanced 70/15/15 split (train 7,021 / val 1,618 / test 1,642), all D11
   leakage gates PASS; Phase 2B distribution gate **PASS WITH WARNINGS** (warnings documented, not blocking).
3. **Phase 3 - Model Design, Training & Evaluation** (`src/models/`, `src/training/`): locked 56,657-param CNN
   (Conv2D 16/32/64 → Dense 32 → Dropout 0.3 → softmax 17) trained and analysed on the locked 74,830-window
   **validation** split (test split never opened). Documented models are **not** conflated:
   - `data/models/baseline_A.keras` (preset A, locked CNN): val window accuracy **0.4243**, macro-F1 **0.4048**
     (74,830 windows); clip mean-softmax 0.4994 / 0.4689 / 0.5193.
   - `data/models/lightweight_cnn.keras` — byte-identical to `archive/weighted_epoch1.keras` (epoch-1 class-weighted
     checkpoint): val window accuracy **0.3804**, macro-F1 **0.3861**; clip mean-softmax 0.5414 / 0.5113 / 0.5321.
   Presets B/C/D/E approved; preset A remains the locked baseline. Preset D features built (train 127,398 / val
   29,363 windows); preset D and E trained with `--pool-freq-only` (25,937 params, time axis preserved).
   YAMNet frozen-embedding baseline scaffolded, extracted (8,639 clips, 87,985 frames, 0 failures), and **fit**:
   validation-side-by-side logistic-head 0.7769 / 0.7426 / 0.7791 vs zero-shot 0.6273 / 0.5955 / 0.6135 vs the CNN
   (`baseline_A` clips) 0.4994 / 0.4689 / 0.5193 — experimental baseline only, **NOT adopted as the perception
   layer** (per §2.6).

Splits must pass the mandatory validation gate (proportion + per-class distribution + leakage + spectrogram +
artifact checks) before any training - Phase 2A/2B gates currently PASS. Phases 4-6 not started.

Before any training, dataset splits must pass a mandatory validation gate: proportion check, per-class distribution
similarity, duplicate/leakage check, representative spectrogram comparison across splits, and detection of excessive
silence or preprocessing artifacts.

## 9. Research / Reference Basis

The concept is informed by the following publication, used as a **design reference / prior-art reference** for the
context-aware noise-cancellation adjustment problem setting:

> Shailesh Maheshwari, Vedant Maheshwari, Rayansh Maheshwari.
> *"Context-Aware Adjustment of Noise Cancellation for Wearable Audio Devices."*
> Technical Disclosure Commons, 27 October 2025.
> <https://www.tdcommons.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=10034&context=dpubs_series>

This project **does not reproduce or reimplement** that work, and does not use its dataset, trained model, or
experimental results. Any implementation here is the project's own work.

The project is also a BTech prototype, not a certified safety-critical product: it does not guarantee detection of
emergency sounds, and it does not claim to control ANC on commercial earbuds unless real hardware integration exists.

## Scope Guardrails

- Laptop-only simulation; no physical hardware / PCB build; no custom earbud hardware development.
- Software-level ANC/Transparency/Safety mode routing; no claim of controlling ANC on commercial earbuds.
- **No automatic emergency action**: the quick action is presentation-only and requires explicit user confirmation;
  no guaranteed emergency detection; not a certified safety-critical product.
- The project is a four-stage **supervisor**, not merely a sound classifier.
- No embedded / microcontroller deployment this semester (future work only).
- Training data from suitable public datasets (UrbanSound8K, ESC-50, AudioSet-derived, and other appropriate public
  sources as justified) — chosen for quality, diversity, balance, provenance and task suitability, not to hit a fixed
  count. Real-mic recording is limited to demo/live validation samples only.
- No cloud dependency as the primary path; local inference is the project goal.
