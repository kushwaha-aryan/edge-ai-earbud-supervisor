"""Global configuration and constants for the Edge AI Earbud Supervisor.

Single source of truth for project paths and fixed hyperparameters.
Referenced by all other modules. Keep this file consistent with the
FINAL_PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md living specification (Rev 2).

Rev 2 note: the original fixed 3-class scheme (Class A continuous hum /
Class B transient danger / Class C quiet) and the "exactly ~1,000 clips per
class with equal final counts" dataset rule are SUPERSEDED by the
user-selectable acoustic trigger architecture. See blueprint §1.3
(historical record) and §5.2 (authoritative dataset requirements).
The trigger class list and all per-class constants are therefore finalized
in Phase 1 and are intentionally left unset here until then.
